# Timothy Bosman’s ScandiWeb Test Assignment Submission

## Intro 📣
This project was made to demonstrate my React proficiency. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. It allowed me to learn new tools and expand my React and CSS knowledge. I am very much open to constructive criticism so if there are any problems I would be happy to know.

If you would like to get in contact or learn a bit more about me you can visit my [website](www.timothybosman.co.za). 


## Required Features & Functionality 🛠
I have implemented all the required features dictated by the test assignment document.
This includes:
- Product List Page (PLP)
- Product Details Page (PDP)
- Cart
- Cart Modal
- Currency Selection Modal

All functionality has also been included. For example, it is possible to item attributes before adding them to the cart and it is possible to change the desired currency. In addition to the requested functionality, I have also included a few extra features. For example, I made an attribute selection modal for the PLP page. This allows for any product to be added to the cart from the PLP page. 

## Dependences 🧱
As requested by the test assignment document, I kept the dependencies for this project at a minimum. Below is a list of the dependencies that I added after using CreateReactApp:
- react-dom
- react-router-dom
- styled-components
- opus (GraphQL client)

## Responsiveness 📱
Responsiveness was a high priority for me when working on this project. The website should scale to almost any screen size, including mobile.

## Setup 🏃‍♂️
- Install all dependencies: `npm install`

- Build and Run: `npm run start`

Note: Double-check that the backend graphQL endpoint has been configured properly. You can change the endpoint in the .env file.
